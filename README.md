BhGesturePad for Gideros 
========================

This software is multi-stroke gesture recognition library for Gideros Mobile SDK.
It is an extension of the Lua implementation of Protractor unistroke gesture 
recognition by Arturs Sosins (http://appcodingeasy.com). The original Gesture.lua has been
included untouched but the stroke capture and drawing component is not used. This version
extends the algorithm to include multistroke gestures with my version of n-Protractor.
